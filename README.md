### ðŸ”­ About Me
I am Tonghe Zhang (he/him). 

**I am working on** robot learning, teaching robots to learn on their own.

**My vision** is to make robots learn efficiently from prior knowledge and through trial-and-error, creating intelligent, reliable, and efficient robotic systems cost-effectively. 

**In the past**, I have worked on generative modeling, statistical reinforcement learning (RL) theory, and humanoid loco-manipulation. 

### ðŸ‘¯ Get in Touch
I'm currently pursuing my Master of Science in Robotics (MSR) at the [Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/). Feel free to reach out for collaborations or just to chat! 

Here is my email: [tonghez@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:tonghez@andrew.cmu.edu) and my [personal website](https://tonghe-zhang.github.io/).
