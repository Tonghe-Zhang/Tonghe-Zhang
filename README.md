### ðŸŒŸ About Me

ðŸ¤– **My Focus**: I am working on robot learning, teaching robots to learn on their own.

ðŸš€ **My Vision**: To make robots learn efficiently from prior knowledge and through trial-and-error, creating intelligent, reliable, and efficient robotic systems with ease. 

ðŸ“š **My Background**: I have been doing reinforcement learning theory, deep reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sim-to-real robotics in the past. 

### ðŸ‘¯ Get in Touch
I'm currently pursuing my Master's of Science in Robotics at the [Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/). Feel free to reach out for collaborations or just to chat! Here is my email: [tonghez@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:tonghez@andrew.cmu.edu)
