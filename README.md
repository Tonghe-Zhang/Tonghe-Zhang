### 🔭 About Me
I am Tonghe Zhang (he/him). 

**I am working on** robot learning, teaching robots to learn on their own.

**My vision is** to make robots learn efficiently from prior knowledge and through trial-and-error, creating intelligent, reliable, and efficient robotic systems cost-effectively. 

**In the past**, I have worked on generative modeling, the theory and algorithm design of reinforcement learning, and sim-to-real robotics. 

### 👯 Get in Touch
I'm currently pursuing my Master of Science in Robotics at the [Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/). Feel free to reach out for collaborations or just to chat!
