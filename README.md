### 🔭 About Me
My name is Tonghe Zhang (he/him). It’s pronounced Tung-ho Zang.

**I work on** scalable robot learning. 

**My goal** is to build robot learning systems that are robust, efficient, and dexterous. 

**Previously**, I studied RL for visual-language-action models, humanoid loco-manipulation, generative modeling and statistical reinforcement learning theory. 

### 👯 Get in Touch
