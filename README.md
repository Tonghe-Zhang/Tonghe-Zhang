### 🔭 About Me
My name is Tonghe Zhang (he/him). It’s pronounced Tung-ho Zang.

**I am working on** robot learning. 

**I want to** make robots learn efficiently from prior knowledge and through trial-and-error, creating intelligent, reliable, and efficient robotic systems cost-effectively. 

**Previously**, I studied RL for visual-language-action models, humanoid loco-manipulation, generative modeling and statistical reinforcement learning theory. 

### 👯 Get in Touch
I'm currently a graduate student in Robotics at the [Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/). Feel free to reach out for collaborations or just to chat!
