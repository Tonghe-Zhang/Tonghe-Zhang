### ðŸŒŸ About Me
I am Tonghe Zhang (he/him). 

ðŸ¤– **I am working on** robot learning, teaching robots to learn on their own.

ðŸš€ **My vision is to** make robots learn efficiently from prior knowledge and through trial-and-error, creating intelligent, reliable, and efficient robotic systems cost-effectively. 

ðŸ“š **In the past**, I have worked on reinforcement learning theory, deep reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sim-to-real robotics. 

### ðŸ‘¯ Get in Touch
I'm currently pursuing my Master's of Science in Robotics at the [Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/). Feel free to reach out for collaborations or just to chat! Here is my email: [tonghez@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:tonghez@andrew.cmu.edu)
